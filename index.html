<h1>God of War but its romantic</h1>
<p>
    It was a cold afternoon in Midgard, after all snow is all there is in that kingdom. Atreus had left for a while now
    and Kratos had enough of Mimir's riddle for the rest of the Ragnarok and, kind of guided more from boredom than rage, Kratos
    decided to go for a ride in his sled.
