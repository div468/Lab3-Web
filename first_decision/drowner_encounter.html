<p>
    You keep walking in a long and stinky path through the sewers. There are some grates every now and then. You try to scream for help
    but its useless, no one will get in the sewers to save a simple man. You start to think that it wasn't the best idea to come
    to Novigrad and sell shoes... You really want to get out of there. When you are almost lost on your thoughts, you hear a shriek near by.
    You're scared, but the only path you can see is where the shriek came from, so you walk as all of your body trembles.
    You get to a room where its easily recognizable that illegal fights take place. But there is no time to think about the morality of 
    that business, a drowner noticed you and is rapidly coming after you. Do you have a sword?
