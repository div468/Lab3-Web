                You decide not to pay attention to the bandit and keep walking through the sewers, hoping you somehow reach the end and get back to Novigrad. As you walk past him 
                you look back to check if he isn't following you... He is not.

                He looks confused by the way you reacted, but it seems he's got better places to be and better things to do than bother a simple man. You keep walking through the sewer path and as you get past trash and dirty water you see a bright light that you quickly recognize Novigrad's lanterns...
