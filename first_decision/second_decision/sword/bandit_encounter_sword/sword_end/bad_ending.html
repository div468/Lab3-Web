       With no hesitation you decide to quickly attack him before he does anything to you. While wielding your sword in an attack position, the bandit notices and quickly pulls out a knife you didn't see before.
       It's now or never, you swing your sword direcly to his chest but he deflects it with his armor, leaving you unarmed... There is nothing you can do about the bandit now, how could you think you would be able to defeat him
       with zero experience with the sword?
