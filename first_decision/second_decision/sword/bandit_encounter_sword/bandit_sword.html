        <p>
            As you keep walking through the sewers and remembering what just happened behind with the drowner, you notice light ahead of you. Fueled with excitement you
            run directly to it hoping to be finally out of the sewers, but what you find does nothing but scare you... A bandit carrying a sword and a lit torch in the sewers too.
            What do you do about it?
