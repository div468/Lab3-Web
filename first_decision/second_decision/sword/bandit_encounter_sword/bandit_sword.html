                As you keep walking through the sewers and remembering what just happened with the drowner, you notice light ahead of you. Fueled with excitement, 
                you run directly toward it hoping to finally be out of the sewers.

                    Bandits often hide in forgotten places beneath cities, using the darkness and confusion to their advantage. Not all of them fight for survival some simply enjoy the chaos.

                But what you find does nothing but scare you... A bandit carrying a sword and a lit torch is standing in your path. The shadows behind him dance along the sewer walls. 
                What do you do about it?
