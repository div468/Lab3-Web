            You run as fast as you can back where you came from, hoping to lose the Drowner before you reach the end of the path. All you can think about is running, it feels like if
            your legs were running by themselves. You hear shrieks behind you...
            <br>
            You get to the end of the sewers and try to breath after the marathon you just ran and try to get quiet so the drowner doesn't hear you, but you just remembered something,
            Drowners smell their victims to chase them... By the time you realize, you listen shrieks closer and closer...

            <strong>GAME OVER</strong>
