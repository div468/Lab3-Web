                You don't have a way to defeat the drowner. Now, you gotta think fast so you don't get eaten in a sewer. You can see some light in the path
                behind the creature, but it's dangerous trying to get past that beast.

                You also consider running back to where you came from, hoping the drowner doesn't follow you and that you can continue your escape later. 
                By the time you finish analyzing your options, the drowner has gotten very close to you. What do you do?
