                You decide not to pay attention to the bandit and keep running through the sewers, hoping you somehow reach the end and get back to Novigrad. As you are already far 
                from him, you hear another shriek from behind. You quickly turn your head and see the bandit fighting the drowner.

                    In the darkness of the sewers, survival often forces unlikely confrontations. Not every enemy intends to chase you  sometimes they are simply trying to survive too.

                The drowner wounds the bandit, but in a desperate move he grabs his knife and kills the creature. Injured but alive, he slowly walks back the way he came. 
                You decide this is not the moment to worry about him and keep running. As you pass trash and dirty water, you finally see a bright light you recognize 
                Novigrad's lanterns...
