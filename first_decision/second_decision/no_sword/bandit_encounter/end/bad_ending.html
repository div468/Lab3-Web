                You decide to stop and tell him about the drowner. You feel like he is starting to understand you, but then you look at his clothes... He is a Nilfgaardian, 
                and you are a Temerian.

                    Nilfgaard and Temeria have been enemies for years. After the wars between the Empire and the Northern Kingdoms, many Nilfgaardians view Temerians 
                    as rebels who stood against their expansion and the hatred still lingers.

                It doesn't take long for the bandit to realize it too. You notice the fury growing in his eyes as he steps closer. He's fully equipped for the dangers 
                of the sewers, while all you have is a torch. There is nothing you can do except wait until either the drowner 
                or the bandit reaches you...
