       You decide to stop and tell him about the drowner. You feel like he is starting to understand you but then look at his clothes... He is a Nilfgardian and on the other side, you're a Temerian.
       It didn't take long for the bandit to realize these too. You notice how the fury grows up in his eyes and begins to get close to you. He's fully equipped to get in the sewers while all you have is a torch.
       There is nothing you can do about except to wait until either the drowner or the bandit gets to you....
