            Your reflexes had always been pretty good, when the drowner attacks with its claws, you dodge it, getting yourself in the back of the drowner. The drowner immediately notices it
            and rapidly turns around. By the time it did it completely, you already started running to the path with light ahead.
            <br>
            You run as if your live depended on it (it actually does) and reach the light you saw before. It was a bandit holding a lit torch. He tells you something but you are not listening to him.
            You know what's behind you... What do you do?
