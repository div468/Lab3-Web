                Your reflexes had always been pretty good. When the drowner attacks with its claws, you dodge it, getting yourself behind the creature. 
                The drowner immediately notices and rapidly turns around, but by the time it does, you are already running toward the path with light ahead.

                    Speed and awareness can sometimes compensate for the lack of a weapon. A well-timed dodge may be the only difference between survival and defeat.

                You run as if your life depended on it (it actually does) and reach the light you saw before. It is a bandit holding a lit torch. He tells you something, but you are not listening you know what’s behind you.  
                What do you do?
